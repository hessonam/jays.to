Blue Jays soundboard

To add an audio clip to the soundboard, simply add the audio file (mp3 preferred) to the audio directory, and update the audio/format file to add an entry for the new audio file filling in the parameters as appropriate. Everything else will take care of itself - the order the clips appear on the soundboard in the same order as they appear in the audio/format file. The "file" parameter is the literal name of the audio file, the "name" parameter is what shows up on the soundboard, and the "tag" parameter indicates who said the clip or who it is associated with, and appears as hover tool-tip text.
